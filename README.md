# Proof of Work: Breaking Hash

**Team members**: Jenny Chen, Jeffrey Kwan, Seongbin Park, Anastasia Simonova, John Wang

## Summary
 Our team used Grover’s search to significantly decrease the compute time it takes to do proof of work (which is what Bitcoin uses). While only in the three-bit case, it shows the implications and impact quantum computers can have with a greater number of qubits at their disposal.
