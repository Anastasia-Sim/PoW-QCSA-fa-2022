# Compare Grover’s Search with Classical “Mining” Algorithms in Solving Proof-of-Work

**Team members**: Jenny Chen, Jeffrey Kwan, Seongbin Park, Anastasia Simonova, John Wang

## Summary
Our team used Quantum Grover’s search to significantly decrease the compute time it takes to do proof-of-work -- technology used by Bitcoin to approve addition of blocks to the blockchain. We use a three-bit system to compare performance of classical vs. quantum proof-of-work. The simplified model demonstrates the impact quantum computers can have with a greater number of qubits at their disposal.

## Roadmap
1. Classical Proof-of-Work
2. Quantum Implementation
3. Comparison
4. Conclusion
